# Australian Coffee Roasters

Your one stop reference to find all the specialty coffee roasters within Australia. 

## MVP: 
- [x] show coffee roasters from JSON file

## To-do: 
- [x] client side filtering of JSON
- [x] theme toggle
- [x] netlify deploy
- [x] confirm and update all cafe info entries as required in JSON (︶︹︶)

## Stretch to-do
- [x] theme selection persists between visits
- [x] footer for contact information to update list (ended up going a different direction on this - created a form element for user submission of issues/recommendations)
- [x] drawer for filter options 
- [x] pagination for results array
- [ ] custom 404 page
- [ ] Maps integration?

## Add a roaster? 
- If I've missed a roaster in the site, let me know via email, by the form on the website, or by opening an issue on this repo.
